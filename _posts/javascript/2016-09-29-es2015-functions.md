ES2015 has some improvements for **functions** including the **lexical this**, **implicit return** and more. All in a short syntax, so let's use new ES2015 syntax for functions.

## Previous Episode

In the previous episode [ES2015 Classes][blog-es2015-classes] we saw how to use new ES2015 syntax for classes and now it's time to see functions.

We also saw that modern browsers will implement ES2015 specification very soon, such as chrome (most of features released already). Also remember that you can always compile your ES2015 code to work with current/old browsers using ES5.

## ES5 Anonymous Functions

```javascript
var log = function(msg){ console.log('=> '+msg); };
log('Hello');
//=> Hello
```

## ES5 Named Functions

```javascript
function log(msg){ console.log('=> '+msg); };
log('Hello');
//=> Hello
```

## ES2015 Class Functions

ES2015 has a new syntax for functions that resides inside classes (also new on ES2015).

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
  park(garage){
    console.log('Parking the ' + this.color + ' car in ' + garage + '.');
  }
}

var car = new Car('red');
car.park('garage building 1st floor');
//=> Parking the red car in garage building 1st floor.
```

## ES2015 Arrow Function

Arrow functions `=>` are a really nice shorthand syntax for anonymous functions. It also comes with with the lexical `this`, in other words `this` inside the function will be the same as outside the function.

```javascript
var log = msg => { console.log('=> '+msg); };
log('Hello');
//=> Hello
```

Wrap function arguments into parenthesis `()` if you have more than one:

```javascript
var log = (user, msg) => { console.log('=> '+user+' said:'+msg); };
log('Bob', 'Hello');
//=> Bob said:Hello
```

If you need to return a value from the arrow function you can remove the curly brackets `{}`:

```javascript
var sum = (a, b) => a + b;
sum(16, 38);
//=> 54
```

Finally here's an example to show the **lexical this** in action:

```javascript
var obj = {
  es5: function(){
    ['a'].map(function(){ console.log(this); });
  },
  es2015: function(){
    ['a'].map(() => { console.log(this); });
  }
};
obj.es5();
//=> Window {...}

obj.es2015();
//=> Object {}
```

As you see the `this` for ES2015 arrow function shares the context with the outside function. That's usually the same as we see with `that = this;` switch, a very often used technique.

## Conclusion

The new ES2015 Function syntax is amazing. Super short to type and faster to read. We don't need `function` and `return` for most of cases. Additionally the **lexical this** is a simple way to use `this` variable in a reliable way, you know what you'll find there.
